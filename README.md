# Welcome to tigershi.com's repo!

This is the GitHub repo for my [personal website](https://tigershi.com). I typically just use it to test new UI stuff.

Its a little bit out of date, to be honest I'm a little embarrased by it anytime someone comments on it but hey, I should just update it. I try to stay on top of security updates at least

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start-api`

This runs the backend which right now I've stripped back down to nothing basically so it doesn't do much. I used to scrape the mercari.jp website with it but that site keeps doing updates that breaks the scraper haha.
